The {{ mwp }} main window and the main user interface elements are:

1. [Menu bar](#menu-bar). The menu options are described later.
2. [Map and Mission](#map-and-mission-settings) settings
3. [Communications and telemetry settings](#communications-and-telemetry-settings)
4. [Map window](#map-area)

7. [Mouse location](#location) (user preference units, cursor or map centre location)
8. [Flight controller](#fc-Information) information
9. [Sensor status and flight timer](#sensors-and-flight-status)

In the sections that follow, there will be a brief summary of each part; more detail will then provided in subsequent sections.

## Menu Bar (1)

The following tables summarise the available menu options. Where usage is not obvious, operation will be described later on.

## Map and Mission Settings (2)

A number of different map provides are available. {{ mwp }} offers the mapping library (`libchamplain`) defaults, Bing Maps (Bing Proxy) using a bespoke {{ mwp }} API key, and [user defined options](../mwp-Configuration#sources-json), for example [anonymous maps](../Black-Ops).

The zoom level may be selected from the control here, or by zooming the map with the mouse wheel.
The **+Edit WPs** button enables mission edit mode (click on the map to create a WP, drag to move, right mouse button for properties). Graphical WP editing may be augmented by the table orientated [mission table view](../mission-editor), which allows additional control (altitude, speed, special functions, for example [fly-by-home](../Fly-By-Home-waypoints-(inav-4-new-feature)) waypoints).

The "Active Mission" drop down supports {{ inav }} 4.0+ [multi-mission](../inav-4.0-multi-missions). There is also a **multi-mission manager** under the **Edit** menu.

## Communications and telemetry settings (3)

There is a (blue "!" in the example) 'navigation safe' status icon. If this icon is shown (i.e. navigation is _unsafe_, then clicking on the item will provide more information:

![navunsafe](images/nav-unsafe.png)

The **Device** drop-down offers detected and pre-set (**Preferences**) devices for the FC / telemetry port. The device syntax is described the [Device and Protocol definition](../mwp-multi-procotol) article.

The **Protocol Selection** drop-down (here showing **Auto**) allows the user to provide a hint as to communication protocols available on **Device**. These are further described in the [Device and Protocol definition](../mwp-multi-procotol) article.

The **Connect / Disconnect** button connects / disconnects the displayed device.

The **auto** button causes {{ mwp }} to automatically attempt to connect to the nominated device.

## Map Area (4)

The map area displays the currently selected map at the desired zoom level. The map may be managed using familiar controls (drag, scroll wheel etc).

!!! info "Graphics Requirement"

    The map API used my {{ mwp }} requires OpenGL / 3D accelerated graphics. Performance with software rendering is likely to be disappointing and CPU intensive.

## Dock Bar (5)

The **Dock Bar** contains essentially minimised [**Docklets**](#docklets), selected from the **View** menu. In the illustration, these are the **Vario** view, **Telemetry** statistics, and **Mission Editor**. Hovering the mouse over the icon will reveal its function:

![dockfunc](images/dockavail.png)

## Docklets (6)

**Docklets** are display items that can be docked, iconised, hidden or displayed in floating windows. See [Dock Management](../dock). In the **main window screen shot** (left to right, top to bottom) we have:

* Radio status (RSSI or LQ)
* Artificial horizon
* Direction Status (Heading (Position Estimator/Compass v. GPS). Useful to diagnose mag EMF interference on multi-rotors).
* Flight View. General geo-spatial information.
* Battery status. Current usage is also shown when available.

## Location (7)

The location (of the mouse pointer), [user setting](../mwp-Configuration#dconf-gsettings) "pos-is-centre" for either mouse pointer or map centre, and format (**Preferences**).

## FC Information (8)

Displays the firmware, version and build with API information, profile and flight mode.

## Sensors and flight status (9)

* Follow : [user setting](../mwp-Configuration#dconf-gsettings) "auto-follow". whether the map always displays the aircraft icon (required GPS).
* In View : Scrolls the map to keep the aircraft in view; otherwise the map is centred on the aircraft (requires GPS).
* Logger : Generate mwp logs (JSON format).
* Audio : [user setting](../mwp-Configuration#dconf-gsettings) "audio-on-arm". Whether to "speak" status information.

The green / red bars show gyro / acc / baro / mag / gps / sonar sensor status. If a required sensor fails, a map annotation will be displayed, together with an audible alarm.
