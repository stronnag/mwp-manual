# mwp Configuration

## Overview

{{ mwp }} stores configuration in a number of places, to some degree at the developer's whim, but also in accordance with the data item's volatility.

* Command line options
* Configuration Files
* dconf / gsettings

Each type is further discussed below.

## Command line options

Command line options provide a 'per instantiation' means to control {{ mwp }} behaviour; the current set of command line options may be viewed by running {{ mwp }} from the command line with the single option `--help`:

```
$ mwp --help
```

Where it is required to give permanence to command line options, they can be added to the configuration file `$HOME/.config/cmdopts`, which is described in more detail in the following section.

### Debug flags

The `--debug-flags` option takes a numeric value defines areas where additional debug information may be output.

| Value | Usage |
| ----- | ----- |
| 1     | Waypoints |
| 2     | Startup |
| 4     | MSP |
| 8     | ADHOC |
| 16    | RADAR |
| 32    | LOG REPLAY |
| 64    | SERIAL |
| 128   | VIDEO |
| 256   | GCS Location |

Values may be added together (so 511 means all).

## Configuration Files

{{ mwp }} configuration files are stored in a standard directory `$HOME/.config/mwp`. This directory is created on first invocation if it does not exist. The following files may be found there:

## `cmdopts`

The file `cmdopts` contains command line options that the user wishes to apply permanently (and conveniently when run from a launcher icon rather than the command line).

The file contains CLI options exactly as would be issued from the terminal. Options may be on separate lines, and blank lines and line prefixed with a hash '#' are ignored. For example:

```
# Default options for mwp
--rings 50,20
#--voice-command "spd-say -t female2 -e"
#--debug-flags=2
--dont-maximise
#-S 8192
```

So here the only current, valid options are  `--rings 50,20 -dont-maximise`

## `.layout`

`.layout` contains the current arrangement of Dock items. You are advised not to manually edit this file (or other named, alternate layout files).

## `sources.json`

`sources.json` facilitates adding non-standard map sources to {{ mwp }}. See the manual and comments in the source files in the `qproxy` directory.

## `vcol.css`

`vol.css` contains alternate CSS themeing for the battery voltage dock item that may work better on dark desktop themes. An example file is provided as `mwp/vcol.css` which can be copied into `.config/mwp/`.

## `places`

The `places` (`~/.config/mwp/places`) file is a delimted (CSV) file that defines a list of "shortcut" home locations used by the "View / Centre on Position ..." menu item. It consists of a Name, Latitude, Longitude and optionally zoom level, separated by a `TAB`,`|`,`:` or `;`. Note that positions may be localised in the file and thus `.` is no longer recognised as a field separator.

Example `places`

```
# mwp places name,lat,lon [,zoom]
Beaulieu|50.8047104|-1.4942621|17
Jurby:54.353974:-4.523600:-1
```

The user may maintain these files manually if used, or use the graphic editor.

## Dconf / gsettings

Linux has a facility for storing configuration items in a registry like facility. This is used extensively by {{ mwp }}. The items can viewed and modified using a number of tools:

* {{ mwp }} preference dialogue (for a small subset of the items)
* The `dconf-editor` graphical editor
* The command line `gsettings` tool

For `gsettings` and `dconf-editor`, the name-space is `org.mwptools.planner`, so to list of items:

```
$ gsettings list-recursively  org.mwptools.planner
```

and to list then set a single item:

```
$ gsettings get org.mwptools.planner log-save-path
..
$ gsettings set org.mwptools.planner log-save-path ~/flight-logs/
```
