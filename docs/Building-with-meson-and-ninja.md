# Building mwp (Generic)

## Overview

The **mwptools** suite is built using the [meson](https://mesonbuild.com/SimpleStart.html) and [ninja](https://ninja-build.org/) toolchain. For most users these will be automatically provided by a `build-essentials` type of package transparently to the user.

Prior to late May 2021, the build system used a convoluted `Makefile`.

For Debian and derivatives (Ubuntu, WSL etc.) there is a simple ["one stop" installation script](#easy-first-time-install-on-debian-and-ubuntu), as well as a x86_64 "Release" .deb archive.

For Arch Linux, you can install using the AUR package `mwptools-git`

## Rationale

In its early days, `make` was a suitable build tool. As **mwptools** has gained in features and functionality, this has become un-maintainable.
The migration to `meson` and `ninja` solves this problem and allows the project structure to be rationalised.

## Usage

### Migration

Please ensure your extant mwptools instance does not have untracked files:

```
git clean -fd -fx
git pull
```

### First time

Set up the `meson` build system from the top level:

```
meson build --buildtype=release --strip [--prefix $HOME/.local`]
```

* For a user / non-system install, set `--prefix $HOME/.local`
    - This will install the binaries in `$HOME/.local/bin`, which should be added to `$PATH` as required.
* For a Linux system wide install, set `--prefix /usr`
* For FreeBSD (*BSD), for a system-wide install,  don't set `--prefix` as the default (`/usr/local`) is suitable

Unless you need a multi-user setup, a local install is preferable, as you don't need `sudo` to install, and you'll not risk messing up build permissions.

* If you're using a really old OS (e.g. Debian 10), you may also need `export XDG_DATA_DIRS=/usr/share:$HOME/.local/share` for a local install.

### Build and update

```
cd build
# for a local install (and cygwin)
ninja install
# for system install
ninja && sudo ninja install
```

### Legacy

For now, some of the legacy `Makefiles` remain, and can be used similar to before, e.g. :

```
cd mwptools/src/mwp
make && sudo make install
```
At some stage, more of the Makefiles will be removed (or just rot into uselessness).

## Files built / installed

### Default

| Application | Usage |
| ----------- | ----- |
| `bbsummary` [1] | Blackbox log summary |
| `cliterm` | Interact with the CLI |
| `fc-get`, `fc-set` [1] | Backup / restore CLI diff |
| `mwp` | Mission planner, GCS, log relay etc. |
| `mwp-area-planner` | Survey planner |
| `mwp-plot-elevations` [2] | Mission elevation / terrain analysis |

Notes:

1. `fc-set` is a hard link to `fc-get`
2. This may either be the new Go executable or the legacy, less functional Ruby script.

### Optional

These are only built by explicit target name; they will be installed if built.

```
# one of more of the following targets
ninja bproxy ublox-geo ublox-cli flashdl
sudo ninja install
```

| ----------- | ----- |
| `flashdl` | Download, optionally delete BBL from flash |

### Troubleshooting and Hints

#### Migrate from a system install to a user install

```
cd build
sudo ninja uninstall
meson --reconfigure --prefix=$HOME/.local
ninja install
```
#### Fixing build permissions

If you install to system locations, it is possible that `sudo ninja install` will write as `root` to some of the install files, and they become non-writable to the normal user.

* In the `build` directory, run `sudo chown -R $USER .`
* Consider migrating to a local install

### Easy first-time install on Debian and Ubuntu

* Download the [first time build script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stronnag/mwptools/master/docs/deb-install.sh)
* Make it executable `chmod +x deb-install.sh`
* Run it `./deb-install.sh Y`
* Note that the script may ask for a password to install system packages
* The resulting executables are in `~/.local/bin`. Ensure this exists on `$PATH`
* If you get messages like `Removing /home/$USER/.config/mwp/.layout.xml 0` and `Failed to save layout, remains in /tmp/.mwp.xxxxxx.xml` you also need `export XDG_DATA_DIRS=$XDG_DATA_DIRS:$HOME/.local/share`; this is fixed in 206efe2 / 4.295.560 of 2021-10-22.

### Help!!!! You've installed a new version but you still get the old one!

If you used the `deb-install.sh` script, then it installed everything into `$HOME/.local/bin` (and other folders under `~/.local`). This is  nice because:

* mwp does not pollute the system directories;
* you don't need `sudo` to install it.

Linux (like most other OS) has the concept of a `PATH`, a list of places where it looks for executable files). You can see this from a terminal:
```
## a colon separated list
echo $PATH
```

So check that `$HOME/.local/bin` is on `$PATH`; preferably near the front.

If it is, then the problem may be  that the older mwp also exists elsewhere on the PATH, and the system will not re-evaluate the possible chain of locations if it previously found the file it wants.

So, maybe you have an old install. You didn't remove it (alas); so the system thinks that mwp is `/usr/bin/mwp`; in fact it's now `$HOME/.local/bin/mwp`

If `$HOME/.local/bin` is on the PATH before `/usr/bin`, the you have two choices:

```
# reset the path search
hash -r
# mwp, where art thou? Hopefully now is ~/.local/bin
which mwp
# From **this terminal** executing mwp will run the location reported by `which mwp`
```
or

Log out, log in. The PATH will be re-evaluated.

If `$HOME/.local/bin` is not on PATH. then it needs to be added to a login file (`.profile`, `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile` etc.). Modern distros do this for you, however if you've updated an older install you may have to add it yourself.

```
# set PATH so it includes user's private bin if it exists
if [ -d "$HOME/bin" ] ; then
    PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
fi

# set PATH so it includes user's private bin if it exists
if [ -d "$HOME/.local/bin" ] ; then
    PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
fi
```

If an older (perhaps Makefile generated) mwp exists; then you should should remove all evidence of an earlier system install.
```
find /usr -iname \*mwp\*
```
review the list and as root, delete the old files. Do similar for blackbox-decode.

If you're content with the list, then (*caveat emptor*):
```
sudo find /usr -iname \*mwp\* -delete
```
You'll still have to remove non-empty directories manually.
